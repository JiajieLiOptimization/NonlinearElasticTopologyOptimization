We propose a new GSSI gradient flow scheme to solve the topology optimization of geometrically nonlinear elasticity modeling by a phase field method. The unconditional energy stability of the gradient flow scheme is shown by analyzing energy variation and overcoming the difficulty over the adjoint variables. Furthermore, the energy dissipation scheme is simple to implement. Moreover, we propose local averaging and superconvergence patch recovery techniques to enhance the accuracy of the discrete gradient flows. We have shown that the optimization algorithm using the gradient recovery method leads to a smoother and more precise final configuration than that without using any gradient recovery method. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm proposed. The present unconditionally stable GSSI gradient flow method is worthy to be studied further in future for possible extending to other topology optimization problems such as designs of eigen-frequency and compliant mechanism.
